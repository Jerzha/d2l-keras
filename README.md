# 《Dive into Deep Learning》 Keras Implementation

* Origin Edition Book : www.d2l.ai
* Chinese Edition : zh.d2l.ai
* English MXNet Code： https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en
* Chinese MXNet Code： https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-zh
* [Chinese Readme](https://github.com/Jerzha/d2l-keras/blob/master/README_zh.md)

## Notes:

1. Dynamic computation graph is not supported in Keras, so I use numpy or tensorflow2.0 instead.
2. I didn't copy the book here. There's only titles and code here.
3. I use livelossplot for tracking training loss and acc.
